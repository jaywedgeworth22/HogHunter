# Hog Hunter — agent notes

> **2026-09-22 — bundle ID migration.**  `com.jayservices.HogHunter` was renamed to
> `com.simplewithus.hoghunter.macos` and a new App Group
> `group.com.simplewithus.hoghunter` + Associated Domain `simplewithus.com`
> were added.  See `docs/rollouts/2026-09-22-bundle-id-migration.md` for the
> full migration context (Previous → New table, cross-repo files touched,
> owner action items).  Internal namespaces (`~/Library/Logs/HogHunter/`,
> Application Support `HogHunter/`, the `"HogHunter"` display name used
> by `osascript` and `pgrep`) are intentionally NOT renamed — they are
> not bundle IDs and renaming them would orphan user history and break
> the running-app quit path.  Future seats: treat `## Bundle identifiers`
> below as canonical.

Mac menu bar utility.  Finds CPU and memory hogs now, over the past hour, and over the past 24 hours.  Quit from the list after confirm.

**Local:** `~/apps/HogHunter`  
**Installed app:** `/Applications/HogHunter.app`  
**Do not** App Store or TestFlight unless the owner asks.

Hosting and routing (apexes, hostnames, hosts, deploy paths): see [`Fleet-OPS/docs/DOMAINS-AND-ROUTING.md`](https://github.com/jaywedgeworth22/Fleet-OPS/blob/main/docs/DOMAINS-AND-ROUTING.md). Built from live Cloudflare, Vercel, Coolify, Namecheap/RDAP, and GitHub APIs by CLAUDE on 2026-09-25; refresh via `Fleet-OPS/scripts/domain-inventory/run-all.sh`.

## Build

```bash
cd ~/apps/HogHunter
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild -scheme HogHunter -configuration Release -derivedDataPath build
ditto build/Build/Products/Release/HogHunter.app /Applications/HogHunter.app
```

Prefer `scripts/install.sh` over the manual steps above — it builds Release, signs with the "Developer ID Application" identity when it is in the keychain (adhoc otherwise), quits the running copy, installs, and relaunches.  It installs to `/Applications` by default when a copy is already there, otherwise to `~/Applications`; pass `--dest PATH` to choose explicitly.  Use `--dry-run` to check what it would do without touching the running app or the destination, or `--no-launch` to skip the relaunch.

`HogHunterTests` (XCTest, `Tests/HogHunterTests/`) covers pure logic such as `HogFormat`.  Run with `xcodebuild -scheme HogHunter -destination 'platform=macOS' test`.  CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the same on every push to `main` and every pull request.

No LaunchAgent.  The running menu bar app is the sampler.  History only covers time it has been open.

## Copy

Light default.  Title Case chrome.  Body sentence case with two ASCII spaces.

## Bundle identifiers

| Surface | Bundle ID | Source |
|---|---|---|
| macOS app (`HogHunter`) | `com.simplewithus.hoghunter.macos` | `project.yml` `targets.HogHunter.settings.base.PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` |
| macOS unit tests (`HogHunterTests`) | `com.simplewithus.hoghunter.macos.tests` | `project.yml` `targets.HogHunterTests.settings.base.PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` |

| Capability | Value |
|---|---|
| App Group | `group.com.simplewithus.hoghunter` (`com.apple.security.application-groups` in `HogHunter.entitlements`) |
| Associated Domain | `simplewithus.com` (`com.apple.developer.associated-domains` in `HogHunter.entitlements` — `applinks` + `webcredentials`) |

`XcodeGen` is the project source of truth (`project.yml`); the generated
`HogHunter.xcodeproj/` is git-ignored.  Always regenerate after editing
`project.yml`: `xcodegen generate`.

`Info.plist` is auto-generated (`GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE: YES`); there is no
checked-in `Info.plist` file, so the bundle ID flows from the build variable.

Full migration context: `docs/rollouts/2026-09-22-bundle-id-migration.md`.
Pre-rename IDs (`com.jayservices.HogHunter`, `com.jayservices.HogHunterTests`)
are intentionally absent from this table; archaeology is preserved in the
rollout doc and `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md`.

## Internal namespaces (NOT bundle IDs — do not rename)

These are user-visible paths and process names; renaming them would
orphan existing user state or break the running-app quit path on every
installed copy.  They are kept stable across the bundle-ID migration.

- `Sources/History/HistoryStore.swift:83` — `Library/Application Support/HogHunter/`
  (history SQLite + samples directory).
- `Sources/Store/ProcessControl.swift:22` — `"HogHunter"` display name used
  for `osascript -e 'tell application "HogHunter" to quit'` and `pgrep -x HogHunter`.
- `Sources/UI/RowView.swift:156` — `~/Library/Logs/HogHunter/` (Sample-for-3-Seconds
  report target).
